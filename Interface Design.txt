Keep it simple.

Area for playing the video/audio (using vlcj).
- Play the video with various volume controls (with or without audio)
- Fast forward and backward through the file
- If there is no audio signal the user should be given a warning message.

If possible a timeline would be amazing but is probably too difficult.

Buttons for all the key features:
- Download a video
- Strip out the audio from the video and save this audio to a file.
- Replace the audio track
- Overlay the audio on the existing audio track
- Create title page(s)
- Create a credits page(s) for the video
